Only users with the ‘Manager’ permissions can edit which users are assigned or responsible for units.

_What’s the difference between being assigned a unit and being responsible for it?_

Assigned editors and responsible curators can both edit a unit. However, only one person can be responsible for a unit, but multiple people can be assigned to it. You can use this functionality to spread out the workload of updating units. This also means that other people can make changes if you are on holiday when a specific unit gets changed.

There are two ways to edit user and unit permissions: via the 'Account' page in the top right corner of the screen, or in the 'View Units' tab in the 'Actions' bar at the top. It doesn’t matter which you choose to use, as they lead to the same place.

_To upgrade a Viewer to be an Editor:_

Currently, the Viewer must have logged into the JtD app at least once before they can be upgraded to an Editor.

- Click 'Manage User Permissions'

- Click 'Upgrade Viewer to Editor'

- The list will show you any Viewers who don’t have Editor permissions. Select someone from here

- If they do not show up on this list, they likely have not logged into the app yet.

_To reassign all units from one person to another (e.g. when someone has left the Museum):_

- Click ‘Manage User Permissions’

- Select the person you are removing units from

- Click ‘Change User’s Role’

- If they are a responsible curator, you will have the option to choose a new curator to assign all their units to

- Once you have chosen from the dropdown, click ‘Confirm Role Change’

_To reassign a single unit:_

- To reassign a small number of units, use the ‘Edit Unit Permissions’ page.

- Use the dropdowns to edit either the Responsible Curator or the Assigned Editors

- If you change the Responsible Curator, they will remain on the Assigned Editors list unless you remove them
