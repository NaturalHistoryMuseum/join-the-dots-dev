You can start a rescore either by clicking on the 'Rescore' tab in the nav bar or in the 'Actions' section of the homepage.

Select the unit you want to rescore. You will see expandable sections for the unit info and each category underneath.

Expand the category you wish to edit and change the rank scores. These should add up to 100% for each row. Data validation is built-in to the app, so if the numbers for a row don't add up to 100%, the system will alert you to this.

Your changes will be auto-saved as you go, but will not be made permanent until you press submit. If you make a mistake, you can press Ctrl+Z to undo it until you either leave or refresh the page.

Once you've finished editing a category, you can mark it as complete.

Once you have finished the rescore, press the 'Review and Submit' button to review and then commit your changes.
