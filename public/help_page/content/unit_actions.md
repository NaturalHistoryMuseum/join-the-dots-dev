Both splitting and combining units can be done on the 'View Units' page.

To split a unit: select the unit you want to split and use the 'Split Unit' button at the top right hand of your list of units.

Confirm how many units you want to split that unit into. New units will be created and automatically assigned to you. You must now go into those new units you've just created and edit them accordingly.

To combine two or more units: select the units you want to combine and use the 'Combine Unit' button at the top right hand of your list of units.

Confirm which unit you want to act as the Primary unit for the combine. This unit data will be used for the resulting unit that is created.

The new unit will be created and automatically assigned to you. You can now go into that new unit you've just created and edit the data accordingly.
