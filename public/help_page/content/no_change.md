Even if no changes have affected a unit recently, it is still important to record this at the end of every reporting year to keep the system updated. This helps with strategic planning activities for the next financial cycle, and also makes it easier to see when a unit last changed.

You will be able to tell that a unit has been marked as having no changes on the ‘Rescore’ tab. If the date in the ‘Last Assessed’ column differs from the ‘Last Rescored / Edited’ column, this shows that a curator assessed it at this time and confirmed that no changes had been made.

To do this, start a rescore either by clicking on the 'Rescore' tab in the nav bar or in the 'Actions' section of the homepage. Make sure you are starting a new rescore – you may need to complete an in- progress one before doing this.

Select the units where no changes have been made, and click ‘Mark As No Changes’.

Press the ‘Confirm Assessment' button to review and then commit your changes.
