To view unit data, either use the 'View Units' tab in the nav bar or click on the 'View units' action tab from the homepage.

Down the left-hand side of the screen, you'll see a range of filters to help you find the data you need.

If you are responsible for certain units, these will automatically be displayed. If you wish to search all units, simply uncheck the 'Show only my assigned units' box at the top of the Filters menu.

Select the unit you want to view and use the subsequent tabs to navigate through the information: Unit details, Properties, Storage, and Scores. The information fields displayed under these tabs may vary slightly depending on the department the unit belongs to.

Most recent scores can only be viewed in this workflow. If you wish to edit scores for your units, that can be done using the 'Rescore' tab in the nav bar or from the homepage.
