Join the Dots functionality is restricted to your user permissions levels, so the options you see may vary depending on if you are a Viewer, Editor, or a Manager. You can confirm your user type and view other account information by clicking on the person icon in the top right-hand part of the screen. Managers can also assign user permissions for people in their team.

The navigation bar includes tabs that can be accesses from any page on the site:

Home: return to the homepage. If you do this while in the middle of a rescore or unit edit, your changes will automatically save, and you can return to them later.

View Units: All users can view unit data and apply filters to find the data they need. Editors can also edit unit information, delete, split and combine units from this screen. Editors can only edit the assigned units that they are responsible for. All users can view scoring data in this view, but scores must be edited using the Rescore tab.

Rescore: Editors can edit scores for their assigned Join the Dots units. Information and guidance on the different criteria are included in the workflow. Editors can also perform bulk updates and mark units as having no changes.

About: Information on the app and the Join the Dots framework.

Reports: All users can access the Join the Dots dashboard. Different data views and exports are coming soon.

The homepage also displays some quick-action options at the bottom of the screen (Rescore, View Units and Reports)
