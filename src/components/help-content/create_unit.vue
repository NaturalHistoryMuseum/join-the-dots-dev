  <p>
    If you need to create a new unit (e.g. not one which involves splitting an
    existing unit), you can do this in the 'View Units' page.
  </p>
  <p>
    The progress bar will update to show you how many of the mandatory fields
    you have left to fill in.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that you cannot yet part-complete new units. We intend to add
    this functionality soon, but for now you will need all the required fields
    before you start.
