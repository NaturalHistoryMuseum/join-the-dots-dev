    When editing or rescoring units, the app auto-saves edits as you go, so you
    can safely return to your work later if needed. However, no changes will be
    reflected in the Join the Dots data until you are happy with your changes
    and have submitted them using the 'Review and submit' button.
  </p>
  <p>
    While editing/rescoring, if you make a mistake, you can press Ctrl+Z to undo
    it, however if you either leave or refresh the page, you will need to
    correct any mistakes manually.
  </p>
  <p>
    When editing rank scores, these should add up to 100% for each row. Data
    validation is build-in to the app, so if the numbers for a row don't add up
    to 100%, the system will alert you to this.

    Please ensure that you are happy with any edits that you make before
    submitting them. If you discover that a mistake has been made after
    submitting a change, please contact the admin team by emailing
