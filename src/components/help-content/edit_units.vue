    In the 'View/Edit' unit page (see above), if you are an Editor responsible
    for the unit you are viewing, you can make edits directly in the editable
    fields displayed.

      >Please note that any changes will automatically be saved as you make
      them. However, they will not be committed to the database until you press
      submit.</strong

    This means you can fill in the rescore over multiple sessions without having
    to worry about your data disappearing. You can rectify a mistake by using
    Ctrl+Z so long as you do not leave or refresh a page, or you can change the
    numbers back to the previous number so long as you haven’t pressed submit.
