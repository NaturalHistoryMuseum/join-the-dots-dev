    Join the Dots functionality is restricted to your user permissions levels,
    so the options you see may vary depending on if you are a Viewer, Editor, or
    a Manager. You can confirm your user type and view other account information
    by clicking on the person icon in the top right-hand part of the screen.
    Managers can also assign user permissions for people in their team.

    The navigation bar includes tabs that can be accesses from any page on the
    site:
  </p>
  <p>
    Home: return to the homepage. If you do this while in the middle of a
    rescore or unit edit, your changes will automatically save, and you can
    return to them later.
  </p>
  <p>
    View Units: All users can view unit data and apply filters to find the data
    they need. Editors can also edit unit information, delete, split and combine
    units from this screen. Editors can only edit the assigned units that they
    are responsible for. All users can view scoring data in this view, but
    scores must be edited using the Rescore tab.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rescore: Editors can edit scores for their assigned Join the Dots units.
    Information and guidance on the different criteria are included in the
    workflow. Editors can also perform bulk updates and mark units as having no
    changes.

    Reports: All users can access the Join the Dots dashboard. Different data
    views and exports are coming soon.

    The homepage also displays some quick-action options at the bottom of the
    screen (Rescore, View Units and Reports)
