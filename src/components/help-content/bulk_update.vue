    If you wish to make the same change to several units at once, start a
    rescore either by clicking on the 'Rescore' tab in the nav bar or in the
    'Actions' section of the homepage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Select all the units you want to rescore and then click on the ‘Bulk Update’
    button at the top right-hand side of the list. You'll then see expandable
    sections for each Join the Dots category.
  </p>
  <p>
    Expand the category you wish to edit and change the rank scores. These
    should add up to 100% for each row. Data validation is build-in to the app,
    so if the numbers for a row don't add up to 100%, the system will alert you
    to this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your changes will be auto-saved as you go. If you make a mistake, you can
    press Ctrl+Z to undo it until you either leave or refresh the page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please be aware that your edits will affect all the units you have selected
    to bulk update. If there are no changes to a category or criterion, you may
    leave them unedited or mark them as complete.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have finished the bulk update, press the 'Review and Submit' button
    to review and then commit your changes.
