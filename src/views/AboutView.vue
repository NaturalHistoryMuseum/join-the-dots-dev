      <p>
        Join the Dots (JTD) is a cross–disciplinary collections assessment
        framework. It is based on a methodology called ‘Move the Dots’, which
        was developed by the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in
        2009. Join the Dots quantifies collections and captures information
        across 4 assessment categories: Condition, Importance, Information, and
        Outreach. These categories are divided into 17 more detailed criteria.

      <h2 class="h2-style">Why has Join the Dots been implemented?</h2>
      <p>
        The Natural History Museum has a responsibility to provide the best
        possible care and access to its collections. The development and
        implementation of new collection management systems and methodologies is
        integral to this ongoing duty of care. The NHM strategy crosses
        disciplines, and integrates research agendas with public engagement
        outputs. Capturing the state of collections items is necessary for
        effective resource planning across the Museum. The design of Join the
        Dots reflects the often holistic nature of curation and collections
        planning, particularly at large museums, whilst setting standards and
        measuring improvements where possible.
